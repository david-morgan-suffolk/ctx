# AGENTS.md

Canonical agent entry for this repo. Compact and operational. Deeper durable context lives in `.context/`.

## Project Context

- [.context/project-context.md](.context/project-context.md) — what this app is, architecture, ownership map, integrations, durable decisions.
- [.context/engineering-guide.md](.context/engineering-guide.md) — commands, TypeScript/React standards, testing, safety.
- [.context/writing-tdds.md](.context/writing-tdds.md) — how to write a Technical Design Document for this repo.
- [.context/README.md](.context/README.md) — `.context/` conventions: durable guides vs. ephemeral `active/` design docs (`YYYYMMDD-<title>.md`, deleted when the work lands).

## Stack

React + Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS frontend. Forms via `react-hook-form` + Zod. TODO: state library (MobX / Zustand / Context+useReducer). TODO: router. TODO: test runner (Vitest + Playwright recommended).

## Commands

Package manager: TODO (pnpm / npm).

```
<pkg> install
<pkg> run dev          # Vite dev server with HMR
<pkg> run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
<pkg> run lint         # ESLint or Biome
<pkg> run build        # production build to dist/
<pkg> run preview      # serve built bundle
<pkg> run test         # Vitest (component + unit)
```

Cite exact script scope. Do not claim a command runs every test unless `package.json` proves it.

## Standards

- Strict TypeScript. No `any` except at SDK boundaries; isolate and comment.
- `src/client/` (browser code), `src/shared/` (cross-boundary types). If a backend exists in this repo, it lives in `src/server/` and **`src/client/` must not import from it** — share types via `src/shared/` only.
- Every async surface renders four states: idle, loading, success, error. Do not hide failed responses.
- Forms: `react-hook-form` + Zod resolver. Validate on the user-input boundary.
- Tailwind + CSS variables for theming. shadcn/Radix UI for unstyled primitives.
- Environment variables exposed to Vite must be non-sensitive. Browser env never contains backend secrets.

## Safety

Do not read `.env`, `.secrets`, certs, tokens, DSNs, cloud credentials. Full list in `.context/engineering-guide.md`. Use `.env.example` for variable names only.

Search scope, settings discipline, and commit style live in [`.context/engineering-guide.md`](.context/engineering-guide.md).

## Where To Edit

| File | Owns |
|---|---|
| `src/client/` | React components, UI state, API client helpers, routing. |
| `src/shared/` | Cross-boundary TypeScript contracts (request/response, domain types). |
| `vite.config.ts` | Dev proxy, plugins, build output. |
| `tailwind.config.ts` | Theme tokens, content globs. |
| `.context/` | Durable architecture, decisions, debt. Update when shape changes. |
| `AGENTS.md` | This file. Keep compact; push detail into `.context/`. |

## Maintenance

Update commands here when `package.json` scripts change. Update `.context/` when architecture, integrations, or durable decisions shift. Track in-flight work in a dated `.context/active/` doc; delete it when the work lands.
